        <h3>What we observed:</h3>
        <p>
          The footbridge that crosses the citys railway line. It is a quiet, calm setting yet you are a stones throw away from the city and a shop. We expierenced the softened sound of cars, trains and planes that gives you a sense of peace. Shoppers
          and
          walkers passed us made up of individuals and groups, students, adults and familys. We heard a varity of languanges spoken and saw people of different abilities. The bridge offers disabled access with a ramp at one end and a lift at the
          other.
          Their constant presence remind you that you are still surrounded by civilisation.
        </p>
        <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
        <p>
          This feels like an important location for the city, as there is no right or wrong. It is a public footpath yet we didn't feel out of place standing, recording and watching the world go by. this is helped by the city of Dundee itself, known
          for being creative with quirky characters.

        <h3>What we observed:</h3>
        <p>
          As part of our research, the three of us ventured up the Law Hill, a known tourist point in Dundee. The Law Hill has such a great history to it and is a pinnacle point in the city. During our observations, we noted only a handful of people
          visiting but all of them there to capture images from the view the Law has to offer. On average, most only spent around ten minutes looking around the panorama view and reading the information the Law provides.
          Though the Law Hill silences the sound of busy, mundane life such as traffic, you are still able to hear the sounds of plane engines roaring as they come in and out of Dundee.

        </p>
        <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
        <p>
          The Law Hill provides quite simply an extraordinary view of Dundee and truly captures the essence of the city. However, it isn’t just the view that can inspire designers, but the sounds too. From the wind blowing, to plane engines, to children playing and casual conversations between the Law’s visitors; there isn’t anywhere else like the Law to hear such a mixture of sounds.
Visiting the Law inspired us as designers to think outside the box. Typically, when out in the field, we rely so much on what we can see, instead of giving our other senses a voice. Taking in not just the sights but also the sounds, can provide a whole new feel to the location.

        <h3>What we observed:</h3>
        <p>
          As the Seabraes Bridge (a.k.a. the Tesco Bridge) is next to one of the biggest supermarkets in the city and because of its proximity to the student’s campus, it is an ideal route point for your pre-shopping walk. Although, the design of the
          bridge is terrific and the view and the soundscape are surprisingly captivating a lot of the people don’t spend plenty of time staying at the bridge and just looking around. Most people walked faster and probably were trying to finish their
          tedious shopping and just head home. The bridge pathway was covered in small stones and gravel and made interesting sounds when people started walking from the different sides. Around the bridge, there were plenty of stickers and posters
          that informed of the youth presence around this sight.

        <h3>What we observed:</h3>
        <p>
          During our trip up the Law Hill, we stopped at the Park just before the final set of stairs that lead to the top. This area consists of park benches, a road that wraps around the hill and stairs to ascend higher, or descended back down. We
          noted several cars driving up to park at the top and observed groups of people relaxing on the grass and having conversations amongst themselves while playing music.
          This section of the Law is much quieter than the top. Instead of hearing the roar of plane engines, we were greeted by the sound of forest birds, gently chirping among the trees and though we could not see them, their song made them known.
